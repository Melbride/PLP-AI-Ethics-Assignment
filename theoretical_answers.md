# Part 1: Theoretical Understanding (30%)

## 1. Short Answer Questions

### Q1: Define algorithmic bias and provide two examples of how it manifests in AI systems.

**Answer:**
Algorithmic bias refers to systematic and unfair discrimination in AI systems that produces prejudiced results against certain groups or individuals. It occurs when algorithms make decisions that systematically favor or disadvantage particular demographics.

**Two Examples:**
1. **Facial Recognition Systems**: Higher error rates for darker-skinned individuals, particularly women, due to training datasets predominantly containing lighter-skinned faces.
2. **Credit Scoring Algorithms**: Systematically denying loans to applicants from certain zip codes or demographics, perpetuating historical lending discrimination patterns.

### Q2: Explain the difference between transparency and explainability in AI. Why are both important?

**Answer:**
- **Transparency**: The openness about how an AI system works, including its data sources, training process, and decision-making methodology. It's about making the system's operations visible and accessible.
- **Explainability**: The ability to understand and interpret why an AI system made a specific decision. It provides human-understandable reasons for individual predictions or outcomes.

**Importance:**
- **Transparency** builds trust and enables accountability by allowing stakeholders to understand system capabilities and limitations
- **Explainability** enables users to validate decisions, identify errors, and ensure fair treatment in critical applications like healthcare or criminal justice

### Q3: How does GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) impact AI development in the EU?

**Answer:**
GDPR significantly impacts AI development through:
- **Right to Explanation**: Individuals can request explanations for automated decision-making affecting them
- **Data Minimization**: AI systems must only collect and process necessary data
- **Consent Requirements**: Clear, informed consent needed for data processing
- **Privacy by Design**: AI systems must incorporate privacy protections from the development stage
- **Data Subject Rights**: Users can access, correct, or delete their personal data used in AI systems
